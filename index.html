  Are Software Updates Really Slowing Down Your Phone.
 </div>

 <div class="text-left">
 Are smartphone companies deliberately slowing down your smartphone with software releases?
 </div>
 <br>
 <div class="highlight-left">
 Perhaps.
 </div>
 <br>
 <div class="text-left">
 But there's more to this than meets the eye...
 </div>

 Apple and Samsung were slapped with a big penalty by Italy's antitrust regulators on Thursday for deliberately slowing down older phones with software updates - a suspicion long held by users. Operating system updates led to

"serious malfunctions and significantly reduced their performance, in this way speeding up their replacement with more recent products,"

they added.

<br><br><br>

Apple is already fixing the problem with iOS 12
after a shocking revelation last year that it was
indeed throttling the performance of older phones.
The company, however, had then said that it was
slowing down performance of older phones to prevent
unexpected shutdowns. Earlier this year, Samsung had
said that it

 </div>
<br>
 <div class="quote">
    "does not provide the software updates to reduce the product performance over the life cycle of the device,"

 </div>
 
 <br>

 <div class="text-left">
   according to reports. 
   <br><br><br>
   Many believe that the slowing down of
older phones is aimed at manipulating
users into buying newer and more
expensive hardware, the phenomenon is
often called 'planned obsolescence'.
While that might be true, there's more
to this than meets the eye.
<br><br><br>
Software releases are important for
end users as they not only bring new
features but also include critical
security updates. The problem,
however, is that each major software
release is made for the latest and a
faster hardware and can't always be
calibrated for older hardware.
<br><br><br>
Shrey Garg, an Android developer from Pune,
says that in certain cases phones do get slow after
software updates.
 </div>
<br>
 <div class="quote">
    "But | would say it would be unfair to generalise
and say that all software updates make older phones
slow. It is also a catch-22 situation for brands as
they have to keep rolling out updates (which are
bound to be heavier with time) while also ensuring
that phones don't slow down,"
 </div>
<br>
 <div class="text-left">
    he explained.
    <br><br><br>
    Mohit Chhabra, software developer from
Delhi, however, said that phones do sometimes have
throttled performance after updates.
 </div>
 <br>
 <div class="quote">
    "Hardware is getting better with the new phones but
    it's the role of the software to make the most of
    the hardware. While we as consumers update our
    phones (to get the most out of the hardware) and
    expect better performance from our phones, we end up
    slowing our phones. Brands claim that the updates
    are targeted at the new hardware, which is required
    to make optimum use of updates, they're deliberately
    slowing down old phones to boost up sales of new
    ones,"
 </div>
 <br>
 <div class="text-left">
he said.
<br><br><br>
Ershad Kaleebullah, editor in chief
of popular technology website The Mr. Phone,
believes that aging hardware is also one of the root
causes of the problem.
 </div>
 <br>
 <div class="quote">
    "It is inevitable no? Older phone means ageing
    hardware. Therefore, it becomes difficult for brands
    to maintain performance parity across
    devices. That said, with iOS 12, Apple has managed
    to make the software run smoothly even on the iPhone
    6,"
 </div>
 <br>
 <div class="text-left">
he said. 
<br><br><br>
He also pointed out that the definition of "old
phone" has changed over the years.
 </div>
<br>
 <div class="quote">
    "What is an old phone? In the context of today's
    cycle - a phones old in 3 years. So let's take an
    example, should iOS 12 run fast on iPhone 6s? Well,
    it does...,"
 </div>
<br>
 <div class="text-left">
    he added,
<br><br>
highlighting that Samsung is yet to roll out Android Pie on its two-year-old Galaxy S7 Edge.

brands are
actually
slowing down
older phones?
